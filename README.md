# Customer Loan Classification

This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to classifying customers into two categories: those whose loans are already paid off and those who defaulted on their loans. We will apply a range of classification algorithms to determine the best-performing one for this specific dataset using accuracy evaluation methods.

**Note:** This notebook is a part of a Cousera course - [Machine Learning with Python IBM]([https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-deep-learning-boulder](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python))


## Dataset Description

The dataset, "Loan_train.csv," contains information about past loans. It includes details of 346 customers, along with their loan status (paid off or defaulted).

## Notebook Contents

In this notebook, we will go through the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: We'll load the dataset using the Pandas library and explore its structure.

2. **Data Visualization**: We'll perform data visualization to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and distributions.

3. **Data Pre-processing**: This step involves feature selection, handling categorical variables, and normalizing data to prepare it for classification.

4. **Classification Algorithms**: We'll implement and evaluate several classification algorithms, including:
   - K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
   - Decision Tree
   - Support Vector Machine
   - Logistic Regression

5. **Model Evaluation**: We'll evaluate the performance of each classification model using the following metrics:
   - Jaccard Score
   - F1 Score
   - Log Loss

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the evaluation metrics, we'll identify the best-performing classification algorithm for this dataset.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/Customer-Loan-Classification.git](https://github.com/MaitreeVaria/machine_learning_ibm_final_lab.git)
